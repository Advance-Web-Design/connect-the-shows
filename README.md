# Connect-the-shows

## Known issues:
  1. can add actors without any movies or shows on the board (use ezra miller and the flash to recreate)
  2. cheat sheet moves stat bar to the middle of the screen and gets it stuck there (i suspect it just allocates space for rendering there and doesn't free it)
  3. if NOT selecting a movie from cheat sheet and hit x, and search for any char/string, everything from the cheat sheet is displayed as search results in the search panel container
  4. whenever a card is behind the header, it cant be clicked
