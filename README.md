# Connect-the-shows

## Known issues:
  1. can add actors without any movies or shows on the board (use ezra miller and the flash to recreate)
  2. cheat sheet moves stat bar to the middle of the screen and gets it stuck there (i suspect it just allocates space for rendering there and doesn't free it)
